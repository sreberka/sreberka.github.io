                        Peter Maddox, 84, had been targeted in Bibury because he owned a yellow Vauxhall Corsa.
                        A photo of his car was posted online, with the caption: "Picture postcard street photobombed
                        by ugly little yellow car."

                        People visiting the village claimed it ruined their photos and someone even vandalised
                        his car causing Â£6,000 worth of damage.

                        Hundreds of people on yellow cars came to support Peter. The car protest,
                        which involved around 100 vehicles, happened in the same week Vauxhall said it would name their yellow colour after the pensioner.
